To repay the loan, you generally write a post-dated check for the full balance, including fees, or you provide the lender with authorization to electronically debit the funds from your bank, credit union, or prepaid card account. If you donâ€™t repay the loan on or before the due date, the lender can cash the check or electronically withdraw money from your account.

Your ability to repay the loan while meeting your other financial obligations is generally not considered by a payday lender.

The loan proceeds may be provided to you by cash or check, electronically deposited into your account, or loaded on a prepaid debit card.
